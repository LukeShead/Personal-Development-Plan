# Personal-Development-Plan

### These are my plans for my future in the years to come.

| Years from now| Goal of time| How to achieve|
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------------:|
|1| I hope to have passed the first year and be on my way to passing the second, whilst gaining knowledge to help me become more professional in the business. | By working hard and making sure that all criteria are met, I will be able to pass the year, as well as this by taking notes on how business practises operate, I will be able to gain experience with them.|
|3| I hope to have achieved and acquired a bachelor's degree in computer silence and started working in a company doing programming | By being able to finish the first course, having a good work ethic and time management plan as well as the knowledge and experience, I will be able to complete the course and find a job. |
|5| Be comfortably within a job and moving up in the ranks, I would like the company to involve some form of game design however application or software design is just as good. | I can do this by impressing the "higher-ups" and having a strong position within the company whilst accepting any roles that require more authority and responsability in order to prove that I can be trusted with more authority.|
|10| I want to be working at a higher position in a gaming company designing games or software related to it, I would like to be earning a decent salary and be living either on my own or with someone else. I would like for my reputation to be built a little better as well, so I will be able to work with many different projects. | I can do this by continuing to show responsability and management skills towards the business, this would give me the oppurtunity to demonstrate and impress people into getting better positions at work and continuing wth CPD. With my reputation I could build it by having my own programs and softwares that I built be used by more people.|

I hope my future keeps improving and I keep rising the ranks through a company and either run a company of my own or even become a free lancer developer.
